                Esports, short for electronic sports, is a form of competition using video games. 
                Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, 
                particularly between professional players, individually or as teams. Although 
                organized competitions have long been a part of video game culture, these were
                 largely between amateurs until the late 2000s,when participation by professional
                gamers and spectatorship in these events through live streaming saw a large surge 
                in popularity.By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game 
                industry, with many game developers actively designing and providing funding for tournaments and other events.

                The most common video game genres associated with esports are multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), first-person shooter (FPS), 
                fighting, card, battle royale and real-time strategy (RTS) games. Popular esports franchises include League of Legends, Dota, 
                Counter-Strike, Valorant, Overwatch, Street Fighter, Super Smash Bros. and StarCraft, among many others.<br><br>
